# Sampling Terms
#     Sample: A subset of a population.
#     Target Population: The population about which we want to make inferences; the population of interest.
#     Sampled Population: The population about which we can make inferences; the population from which we sample.
#     Sampling Unit: A unit that can be selected for a sample.
#     Observation Unit: An object on which a measurement is taken.
#     Sampling Frame: A specification of sampling units in the population from which a sample may be selected

# Three basic types of random probability samples
#     Simple Random Sample (SRS) - population almost same as sample population
#     Stratified Random Sample - sub groups of population(strata), and srs is done on each sample
#     Cluster Random Sample - oservation units are grouped into larger sampling units called clusters. and a random sample within the clusters are taken


# Descriptive vs. inferential statistics
