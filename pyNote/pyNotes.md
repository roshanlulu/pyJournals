#### Week 4

##Day 1
# Session1
- Simple linear regression explanation by tui.
- The quanitification and interpretation of the the correlation value is : 
    - 0.8 < Strong correlation < 1
    - 0.5 < moderate < 0.8
    - 0 < weak < 0.5

## Day2
#Session 1
- Sklearn - linearmodel, preprocessing
- Scikit is better than stats model for predictions. Stats model is more statistically inclined and is better to fit the data/describe your data

## Day3
# Session 1
- Cross validation(divide your data into training and testing datasets). This is a holdout method and is fast.It is also a type of bootstrapping cross validation
- K fold cross validation is when the dataset is divided into large no of subsets. 1 is selected as trainign set and the others are test set. This is done with all possible combinations. This results in less variance in your model.

# Session2 - ianhansel@gmail.com
- CRISP - DM
- ABS Census Data

- DPID
- Identify problem, get the data, identify model, crossvalidate

# Session 3
- `conda install Graphviz`


#### Week 5
## Day 2
# Session 1
- Linear and polynomial regression
- Degree of polynomial increases the no of bends increases
- Depending on how fit your data is , the bends change

# Session2 
- Lasso and ridge are ways to improve your regression models
- This is a good skill to be added 

## Day3

# Session 2 - K NN: Classification
- Classification and clustering are different
